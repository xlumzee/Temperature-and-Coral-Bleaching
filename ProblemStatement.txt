# **Analyzing the Relationship Between Ocean Temperature Anomalies and Coral Bleaching Events**

### **Description**

Investigate how anomalies in ocean temperatures correlate with the frequency and severity of coral bleaching events, using historical data and predictive analytics.

### **Problem Addressed**

Coral bleaching disrupts marine ecosystems and fisheries, threatening biodiversity and the livelihoods of communities dependent on coral reefs.

### **Users/Stakeholders**

- Marine conservationists
- Environmental researchers
- Policy makers
- Tourism industry stakeholders

### **Benefits**

- Understanding triggers of coral bleaching
- Developing strategies to mitigate bleaching impacts
- Informing conservation and restoration efforts
- Enhancing predictive capabilities for future bleaching events

### **Potential Approaches**

- Conduct time-series analysis to correlate temperature anomalies with bleaching incidents.
- Use machine learning models to predict bleaching events based on temperature and other environmental factors.
- Visualize spatial and temporal patterns of bleaching relative to ocean temperature changes.

### **Datasets & Resources**

- NOAA Coral Reef Watch
- Global Coral Bleaching Database
- NOAAâ€™s Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST)
