# Analyzing the Relationship Between Ocean Temperature Anomalies and Coral Bleaching Events
Using the coral bleaching database described in the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01121-y), you can create a variety of insightful visualizations to explore and communicate the relationship between environmental factors and coral bleaching. Here are some ideas:

## 1. Temporal Trends
### Line Plot of Bleaching Events Over Time:
Show the number or percentage of bleaching events globally or regionally over the years (1980â€“2020).
Example: **"Global Coral Bleaching Trends Over Time."**

### Temperature Trends Over Time:
Plot sea surface temperature (SST) trends alongside bleaching frequency to visualize correlations.

## 2. Geospatial Analysis
### Global Heatmap of Bleaching Events:
Map showing the severity or frequency of bleaching events by location.
Use color gradients to indicate bleaching severity.
### Scatter Plot of Site-Specific Data:
Plot locations with markers sized or colored by the percentage of bleaching or environmental factors like SST anomalies.

## 3. Correlation and Causation
### Scatter Plot of Bleaching vs. Temperature Anomalies:
Correlate bleaching severity with SST anomalies or maximum monthly mean SST.
### Boxplot of Environmental Factors:
Compare bleaching percentages across ranges of environmental metrics (e.g., low vs. high turbidity sites).

## 4. Categorical Comparisons
### Bar Plot of Bleaching by Coral Species:
Show which coral species are most affected by bleaching.
### Pie Chart of Bleaching Severity:
Display the proportion of mild, moderate, and severe bleaching events.

## 5. Regional Analysis
### Regional Trends Over Time:
Separate line plots for different regions to compare trends in bleaching and SST.
### Regional Chloropleth Map:
Use regions as polygons shaded by average bleaching severity or frequency.

## 6. Multi-Dimensional Visualizations
### Bubble Plot of Bleaching vs. Environmental Factors:
Use bubble size for bleaching severity, axes for environmental metrics, and color for regions.
### Parallel Coordinate Plot:
Show how multiple variables (SST anomaly, distance to land, turbidity) interact to affect bleaching at different sites.

## 7. Risk Assessment and Projections
### Heatmap of Risk Factors:
Create a heatmap showing combinations of factors (e.g., high SST and low distance to land) that correlate with high bleaching.
### Projection Models:
Use predictive modeling results (if data permits) to visualize future bleaching risks under various temperature scenarios.

## 8. Interactive Dashboards (if using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly Dash)
Allow users to:
* Filter data by year, region, or species.
* Explore specific sites or bleaching events in detail.
* Compare bleaching events with environmental variables dynamically.
Visual Tools used:
- Python Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, GeoPandas.
- Dashboards: Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly Dash for interactive exploration.
